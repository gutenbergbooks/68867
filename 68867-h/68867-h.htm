<h2 class="nobreak">THE THREE DIAMONDS.</h2>
</div>


<p>“Do you remember the diamonds we found
up at old Gray Jake Wagner’s house when we
were making that little raid around Taylorsville?”
was asked of Colonel Andrew M. Benson, of
Portland, Me., by a former companion with
whom he was dining at Syracuse, N. Y. The
colonel at first failed to recall the circumstances,
but on the mention of a certain Miss Wagner’s
name a relaxation of his features showed that all
recollection of the episode was not lost, and the
dinner party was soon in possession of the facts,
as follows: In the latter part of the year 1864,
Colonel Benson, the captain of the First District
of Columbia cavalry, with Colonel James M. Gere,
also captain at the time, Colonel Walpole, of
Syracuse, and Lieutenant Cornell, of Vermont,
were confined in the prison pen at Columbia,
S. C., and during December they escaped and
made their way to Crab Orchard, on Doe River
Cove. There they found a company of 83 struggling<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
Federal soldiers. Though in the heart of the
enemy’s country, the members of this little band
were suddenly stimulated to excessive bravery
by thus meeting with their fellows, and conceived
it would be a fine joke to make a little raid on
Taylorsville, a village nearly 50 miles further
north. The daring of the scheme appeared when,
upon examination, it was found that 30 of the
men had just one round of ammunition, while 31
had only one extra charge. Six, however, were
mounted, and, at the head of this plucky detachment
of cavalry Captain Benson was placed. Captain
Gere led the infantry, and the whole squad
was in command of Lieutenant James Hartley.
Such was the make-up of the band that started
out with more pluck than powder to capture
Taylorsville. About 40 miles of the distance had
been covered when the plantation of a rebel was
reached who was notorious in all the country
round. A halt was ordered to treat with the
owner, Gray Jake Wagner, who was at that time
just walking out to feed his hogs.</p>

<p>“Oh, take what you want; but only spare my
life,” cried Gray Jake Wagner, throwing up his
hands like a flash and dropping his pail of swill
as a bullet whistled past his ear, advising him of
his distinguished visitors.</p>

<p>“We want,” said Captain Benson, “whatever<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
you have of use to us.” And it took but a glance
to tell the astonished planter that nothing could
come amiss to that ragged company so lately escaped
from the horrors of a rebel prison. Now,
among other members of the Wagner family
was a pretty daughter of the old rebel, aged
eighteen, who had just returned from boarding
school to spend the holidays. After listening to
the conversation with her father, and catching a
glimpse of the visitors, she ran frightened to
her own room. The troops swarmed about the
place like bees and rushed into the house at
every door. Several soldiers soon found their
way even to the room of the scared young lady
and demanded the immediate surrender of her
revolver and ammunition.</p>

<p>“I have no revolver,” cried the frightened girl.</p>

<p>“You have,” yelled one of the soldiers with an
oath, “and you will give it up.” But at just this
juncture the tall form of Captain Benson, who was
then a dashing officer of 28, appeared, and he
took in the situation at a glance. Drawing his
revolver, he threatened to drop the first man
who touched a thing in that room or failed to
leave without a word. The men withdrew in
silence, while the frightened Miss Wagner, with
tears and sobs, expressed her heartfelt thanks to
her gallant protector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<p>“What did you find in the house?” asked Captain
Benson of the infantry officer, as they left
the place. “I found these diamonds,” he quietly
added, pointing to three glistening drops on his
shoulder. The raid did not extend very far beyond
Gray Jake Wagner’s. Taylorsville, they learned,
was full of rebel soldiers, and the little party
barely managed to reach the Union lines.</p>

<p>Miss Wagner obtained in some way the address
of her benefactor, and afterward, by letter, it is
said, she sent her thanks, which she could only
partially express in the excitement of their meeting.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BUILDING A BRIDGE IN SEVENTEEN HOURS.</h2>
</div>


<p>In July, 1861, General J. D. Cox’s division was
chasing General Henry A. Wise’s Confederate
forces up the Kanawha River, in West Virginia,
and to impede the rapid advance of the Union
troops the bridge across Pocotaligo Creek was
destroyed. The stream was only a couple of rods
wide, but its banks were steep and the bed of the
creek was too much of a slough to allow fording
by the wagon trains and artillery. The regular
army engineers wanted a few weeks’ time to
prepare plans, and considered it necessary to send
to Cincinnati for tools and material to construct a
bridge. The General, being informed that the<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
Eleventh Ohio Infantry Regiment, then encamped
at “Poco,” had a company composed entirely
of mechanics, sent for the captain, and,
after a short conference with that officer, directed
him to put his men at work. Commencing at
nine o’clock in the morning, in seventeen hours
a substantial “bridge” was built across the creek,
and which was used by army wagons, cannons
and soldiers for a long time, probably until the
war closed. A raft of logs, timbers from a deserted
house, and poles cut in the woods near by,
were the materials used for the bridge, the tools
being a few axes and augers. These practical
bridge-builders were members of Company K,
principally machinists, molders, etc., from the
shops of Lane &amp; Bodley, of Cincinnati, the captain
being their late employer, P. P. Lane, afterward
colonel of the regiment.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">THE COLONEL’S FORAGED BREAKFAST.</h2>
</div>


<p>Colonel Johnson, commanding the 108th Regiment,
Illinois Volunteer Infantry, during the late
war, up to the time he fairly earned and secured
his “single star,” was a strict disciplinarian.
Straggling and foraging were especially tabooed
by him; certain and severe was the punishment
of the culprit who was caught away from his command
without authority, and if any foraged provisions<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
were found on the scoundrel they were at
once confiscated. As it was not practicable to return
the provisions to the lawful owner, the
colonel would have them served up at his own
mess table, “to keep them from going to waste.”</p>

<p>As a consequence, the colonel was cordially
hated by many of his men, and many were the
plans laid down by them “to get even” and circumvent
him, but, owing to his astuteness, they
generally came to grief.</p>

<p>One day a soldier of the regiment, who had the
reputation of being “a first-class, single-handed
forager,” but who had nevertheless been repeatedly
compelled to disgorge his irregularly procured
supply of fresh meat, and as repeatedly to
pass an interval of his valuable time in the regimental
bull-pen, slipped away from camp and,
after an absence of several hours, returned with a
loaded haversack and tried to get to his tent
without attracting any attention. He was noticed,
however, and promptly arrested and escorted to
regimental headquarters.</p>

<p>“Omar, you infernal scoundrel, you have been
foraging again,” said the colonel.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t, eh! Let’s see what is in your haversack.
Leg o’ mutton, eh! Killed some person’s
sheep,” said the colonel. Omar was sent to the<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
guard house as usual, and the foraged property
to the colonel’s cook.</p>

<p>The regimental mess, consisting of most of the
field and staff officers, had fresh meat for supper
and breakfast. During the latter meal the colonel
happened to look out from under the tent fly
that was in use as a mess-room, and noticed
Omar, who was under guard cleaning up around
headquarters, eyeing him very closely. The colonel
remarked: “Well, prisoner, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, colonel,” replied Omar, “except I was
just wondering how you liked your breakfast of
<em>fried dog</em>.”</p>

<p>Consternation seized the party at the table.
With an exclamation or expletive, every one of
them sprang to his feet, and from under the tent
fled.</p>

<p>Omar ran for his life, and at once, as per preconcerted
agreement, over half the men in the
regiment commenced barking and howling like
dogs—big dogs, little dogs, hoarse and fine, bass
and soprano, fortissimo and mezzo-soprano, dogs
’round the corner and dogs under the house—in
short, there was the “dog”-onedest kind of a
racket made until the colonel grasped his sword,
and, foaming with rage, rushed for the men’s
tents; but they were too old to be caught.</p>

<p>For a long time, though, they would “regulate”<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
the colonel if he showed signs of being excessive
by barking, but at their peril, for he would certainly
have killed a <em>barker</em> if discovered.</p>

<p>After that breakfast the regimental mess strictly
abstained from eating any second-hand foraged
meat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE NOBLE ACT OF A HERO.</h2>
</div>


<p>Louis Abear, says the Detroit <cite>Free Press</cite>, was a
private in Company H, Fifth Michigan Cavalry,
and made a good soldier. At the battle of Trevillian
Station he was taken prisoner, and before
his release he was confined in five different prison-pens
and two jails.</p>

<p>While he was in Millen Prison, an exchange of
sixty prisoners was to be made. The officer of the
day told off sixty names at the door of the pen,
but for some reason, probably because he was too
ill, or perhaps dead, one man did not come forth.
At that moment Louis, who had been sent out
after fuel, under guard of course, came through
the gates pushing a wheelbarrow loaded with
wood.</p>

<p>“Here, Louis, here’s a chance for you. We want
sixty men to go North and are short one. Jump
into the ranks here!” exclaimed the officer.</p>

<p>“To be exchanged?” asked Louis, trembling
more than he did when under fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. Be quick.”</p>

<p>“Then take Hank. He’s sick, and will die if he
remains here,” and Louis darted into the hospital
ward. Hank had a pair of pantaloons and shoes,
but no coat or hat. Louis pulled off his, put them
on Hank, and brought him out, weak and tottering.
As Hank filed out the gate and once more
breathed the air of freedom, Louis, hatless and
coatless, took hold of the handles of his wheelbarrow
and started for another load of wood.</p>

<p>Can mortal mind conceive of such an act? It
cost him seven months of a living death, and all for
a man with whom he was not even intimately acquainted.</p>

<p>And now for the other side of the picture. Ever
since the close of the war, until a few months
ago, when Hank died, these two men have lived
right here in Wayne County, Hank with a home
and family, Louis with neither; have met occasionally,
but at no time did Hank ever refer to the
act in Millen Prison that set him free and saved
his life; never invited him to his home; never alluded
to the past, or addressed his savior other
than as a mere acquaintance. On his death-bed,
however, he told the story, and asked his relatives
if they ever had an opportunity, to befriend Louis
for his sake. It was tardy acknowledgement of
one of the noblest acts the world has ever known.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SOME OF LINCOLN’S JOKES.</h2>
</div>


<p>President Lincoln has been made responsible
for so many jokes, writes Ben. Perley Poore, that
he reminds one of a noted Irish wit who, having
been ruined by indorsing the notes of his friends,
used to curse the day when he learned to write
his name, as he had obtained such a reputation
for willingness to oblige that he could not refuse.
Mr. Lincoln might well have regretted ever having
made a joke, for he was expected to say something
funny on all occasions, and has been made answerable
for all manner of jests, stories and repartee,
as if he had combined all the elements of humor,
commonplace heartlessness and coarseness,
mingled with a passion for reviving the jokes of
Joe Miller and the circus clowns. Yet he did say
many excellent things. On one occasion Senator
Wade came to him and said:</p>

<p>“I tell you, Mr. President, that unless a proposition
for emancipation is adopted by the government,
we will all go to the devil. At this very
moment we are not over one mile from hell.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Mr. Lincoln, “as I believe
that is just about the distance from here to the
Capitol, where you gentlemen are in session.”</p>

<p>On one occasion, at a reception, when the crowd
of citizens and soldiers were surging through the<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
salons of the White House, evidently controlled by
the somewhat brusque Western element, a gentleman
said to him:</p>

<p>“Mr. President, you must diminish the number
of your friends, or Congress must enlarge this
edifice.”</p>

<p>“Well,” promptly replied Mr. Lincoln, “I have
no idea of diminishing the number of my friends;
but the only question with me now is whether it
will be best to have the building stretched or split.”</p>

<p>At one of these receptions, when a paymaster in
full major’s uniform was introduced, he said:</p>

<p>“Being here, Mr. Lincoln, I thought I would call
and pay my respects.”</p>

<p>“From the complaints made by the soldiers,”
responded the President, “I guess that is all any
of you do pay.”</p>

<p><a id="Ref_12" href="#BRef_12">Ward Lamon, when Lincoln had appointed him</a>
Marshal of the District of Columbia, accidentally
found himself in a street fight, and, in restoring
peace, he struck one of the belligerents with his
fist, a weapon with which he was notoriously
familiar. The blow was a harder one than Lamon
intended, for the fellow was knocked senseless,
taken up unconscious, and lay for some hours on
the border of life and death. Lamon was alarmed,
and the next morning reported the affair to the
President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>On another occasion a young soldier had fallen
out of ranks when his regiment passed through
Washington, and, getting drunk, failed to join
his regiment when it left the city. To the friend
who came to secure a pardon, Mr. Lincoln said:
“Well, I think the boy can do us more good above
ground than under ground,” and he wrote out the
pardon.</p>

<p>In all such cases as the above, where the ordinary
human weakness was the motive, Mr. Lincoln’s
heart was tender as a woman’s, but to prove
that he could entertain no sympathy for a cool,
deliberate, mercenary crime, he was approached
by the Hon. John B. Alley, of Massachusetts, one
day, with a petition for the pardon of a man who
had been convicted of engaging in the slave trade,
and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and
the payment of a fine of one thousand dollars.
His term of imprisonment had expired, but in
default of payment of the fine, he was still held.
In answer to the appeal for pardon Mr. Lincoln
said: “You know my weakness is to be, if possible,
too easily moved by appeals for mercy, and if
this man were guilty of the foulest murder that
the arm of man could perpetrate, I might forgive
him on such an appeal; but the man who
would go to Africa and rob her of her children
and sell them into an interminable bondage with<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
no other motive than that which is furnished by
dollars and cents, is so much worse than the most
depraved murderer that he can never receive pardon
at my hands. No, he may rot in jail before
he shall have liberty by any act of mine.”</p>

<p>Upon another occasion the wife of a rebel officer,
held as a prisoner of war, begged for the relief
of her husband, and to strengthen her appeal
said that he was a very religious man. In granting
the release of her husband, Mr. Lincoln said:
“Tell your husband when you meet him that I am
not much of a judge of religion, but that in my
opinion the religion that sets men to rebel and
fight against their government because they think
that government does not sufficiently help some
men to eat their bread in the sweat of other men’s
faces, is not the sort of religion upon which men
can get to heaven.”</p>

<p>One day news of a great battle in progress
reached Mr. Lincoln, and his anxiety was so great
that he could eat nothing. Soon after he was seen
to take a Bible and retire to his room, and in a few
minutes he was overheard in one of the most
earnest prayers for the success of our arms. Later
in the day a Union victory was announced, and
Mr. Lincoln, with a beaming face, exclaimed:
“Good news! good news! The victory is ours, and
God is good.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AN ARMY NEWSBOY’S ROMANCE.</h2>
</div>


<p>So many acts of heartlessness and cruelty during
the great civil war have been recorded that it
is a real pleasure to have an opportunity to
record an act of manly kindness on the part of
a gallant Confederate soldier to a Yankee boy.
In the town of Bennington, in the Green Mountains
of Vermont, in the spring of 1861, there lived
a poor woman with six children, five boys and
one little girl, the youngest of the former a stripling
14 years old. When the wires flashed the
news from Washington all over our land that
the rebels had fired upon the old flag at Fort
Sumpter, the four older boys responded to the
country’s call and hurried to the seat of war.
The younger lad, his heart fired with genuine
Green Mountain patriotism, ran away from home
and, eluding pursuit, made his way to the camp
on the Potomac. But his ardor was somewhat
dampened by the discovery of the fact that he
could not, in consequence of his youth and diminutiveness,
enlist as a soldier. Determined to remain
at the front; and having, as the saying is,
to scratch for a living, he went to selling newspapers
to the soldiers. Leaving the camp between
New Baltimore and Warrenton about the
10th of November, 1862, he went to Washington
for a supply of papers. Having accomplished his
object, the young lad set out on horseback for
the camp, having to travel a distance of thirty<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
miles. A change of position by the army during
his absence had occurred, and as a consequence he
ran into the rebel picket line and was taken to
General J. E. B. Stuart’s headquarters, at a hotel
in Warrenton, and from there sent to Libby
Prison, in Richmond, arriving there November 13.
Major Turner was in command of the prison, and
when the young prisoner was brought into his
presence, observing that he was a mere boy, the
Major spoke kindly to him, and, after his name
had been enrolled, asked him the customary question,
if he had any money or valuables about his
person. The frightened boy had managed to
conceal his money, $380, in his boots, and in answer
to the question, put his hand down, and
while a tear-drop glistened in his bright eye and
his boyish lip quivered, he brought it forth and
handed it to the rebel major, and trying hard
to choke down the swelling in his throat, he told
of his widowed mother at home, his four brothers
in the army, his having made his money selling
papers, and saving it to send with his brothers’
wages to his mother. The Major folded the boy’s
passes around the money and said to him: “You
shall have this again, my boy, when you are permitted
to go from here.” Six weeks afterward
the lad was paroled, and, repairing to Major
Turner’s office, the kind officer, handing him
the package of money and the passes, just as he
received them, said: “Here is your money, my
boy.” With trembling hands, but a joyous heart,
the little fellow took the package. He was sent
to Washington, and a few weeks afterward was
going his old rounds selling newspapers. The
boy was Doc Aubrey, the newsboy of the Iron
Brigade, who now resides in Milwaukee.</p>
